# inflectweather

This is a weather app that shows the current temperature for the user input location

## Getting Started
1. Run 'yarn start' in your terminal
2. Open browser to 'localhost:3000'

## Developer Notes:

### Future features:
-geolocation for automatically determining location
-options for viewing multiday forecasts (graphs, charts, and other data visualizations)
-icons for visualizing the weather

### Dependencies:
Besides React, the only other dependency I used was css-toggle-switch, which was a quick and dirty way of getting a functional and aesthetically pleasing toggle button.

### Stylistic choices:
I chose to center everything because the app is relatively simple and works well as a dynamic page. The background does not detract from the functions or obscure the text.
